A CLI tool for managing Python virtual environments using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv). Think `pyenv-virtualenv` but powered by the speed of `uv`.

## Features

- üöÄ **Fast**: Leverages uv's speed for Python installation and environment creation
- üéØ **Simple**: Intuitive CLI commands for common virtual environment operations
- üîí **Reproducible**: Lockfile support for consistent environments across systems
- üêö **Shell Integration**: Easy activation/deactivation in bash, zsh, fish, and PowerShell
- üìä **Rich Metadata**: Track environment descriptions, tags, usage patterns, and project links
- üßπ **Smart Cleanup**: Automatic detection and removal of unused environments
- üìà **Usage Analytics**: Detailed insights into environment usage and health status

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install uvve
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is installed:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Install shell integration (one-time setup)
uvve shell-integration >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc

# Install a Python version
uvve python install 3.11

# List available Python versions
uvve python list

# Create a virtual environment
uvve create myproject 3.11

# Create with rich metadata
uvve create myapi 3.11 --description "Customer API" --add-tag production --add-tag api

# Interactive metadata entry (prompts for description and tags)
uvve create webapp 3.11

# Activate the environment (with shell integration)
uvve activate myproject

# List environments
uvve list

# Create a lockfile
uvve lock myproject

# View environment analytics
uvve analytics myproject

# Check environment health
uvve status

# Clean up unused environments
uvve cleanup --dry-run

# Edit environment metadata
uvve edit myproject --description "My web API" --add-tag "production"

# Remove an environment
uvve remove myproject
```

## Understanding Environment Activation

There are two ways to work with uvve activation:

### Method 1: Direct Evaluation (Recommended)

```bash
eval "$(uvve activate myproject)"
```

This **actually activates** the environment in your current shell session. The `eval` command executes the activation script that `uvve activate` outputs.

### Method 2: Manual Activation

```bash
uvve activate myproject
# Outputs: source /Users/username/.uvve/myproject/bin/activate

# Then manually run the output:
source /Users/username/.uvve/myproject/bin/activate
```

This **just shows** the activation command. You need to copy and run the output manually.

**Why use `eval`?**

- ‚úÖ Activates the environment immediately
- ‚úÖ Works in scripts and automation
- ‚úÖ Single command instead of two steps
- ‚úÖ No copy-pasting required

## Environment Storage

Virtual environments are stored in `~/.uvve/`:

```
~/.uvve/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ myproject/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/activate           # Activation script
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib/python3.11/        # Python packages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uvve.lock            # Lockfile (TOML format)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ uvve.meta.json       # Metadata (usage, tags, description)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ another-env/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

## Rich Metadata and Analytics

uvve tracks rich metadata for each environment including:

- **Usage Statistics**: Activation count, last used date, usage frequency
- **Descriptions and Tags**: Organize environments with custom descriptions and tags
- **Project Linking**: Associate environments with project directories
- **Size Tracking**: Monitor disk usage for cleanup decisions

### Analytics Commands

```bash
# View detailed analytics for an environment
uvve analytics myproject

# Check health status of all environments
uvve status

# Find and clean unused environments
uvve cleanup --dry-run
uvve cleanup --unused-for 60 --interactive

# Edit environment metadata
uvve edit myproject --description "Production API server"
uvve edit myproject --add-tag "production" --add-tag "api"

# List with usage information
uvve list --usage --sort-by usage
```

## Shell Integration

### Option 1: Built-in Shell Integration (Recommended)

Install uvve's shell integration to make `uvve activate` work directly:

````bash
# One-time setup:
uvve shell-integration >> ~/.zshrc  # for zsh
uvve shell-integration >> ~/.bashrc # for bash

**After installation, you can use:**

```bash
uvve activate myproject    # No eval needed!
uvve list                  # Works normally
uvve python install 3.12  # Works normally
````

### Option 2: Manual Shell Functions

Add to your shell config for easier activation:

> **Note:** These functions use `eval "$(uvve activate ...)"` to actually activate the environment, not just print the activation command.

### Bash/Zsh

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
uvactivate() {
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "Usage: uvactivate <environment_name>"
        return 1
    fi
    eval "$(uvve activate "$1")"
}
```

### Fish

```fish
# Add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish
function uvactivate
    if test (count $argv) -eq 0
        echo "Usage: uvactivate <environment_name>"
        return 1
    end
    eval (uvve activate $argv[1])
end
```

## Shell Completion

uvve supports tab completion for commands and arguments:

### Auto-Install Completion

```bash
# Install completion for your current shell
uvve --install-completion

# Restart your terminal or source your shell config
```

### Manual Installation

If auto-install doesn't work, you can manually add completion:

```bash
# Show the completion script for your shell
uvve --show-completion

# Add it to your shell config manually
uvve --show-completion >> ~/.zshrc      # for zsh
uvve --show-completion >> ~/.bashrc     # for bash
```

**What you get with completion:**

- ‚úÖ Command completion (`uvve <TAB>` shows available commands)
- ‚úÖ Subcommand completion (`uvve python <TAB>` shows `install`, `list`)
- ‚úÖ Environment name completion (`uvve activate <TAB>` shows your environments)
- ‚úÖ Option completion (`uvve --<TAB>` shows available options)

## Lockfile Format

uvve uses TOML lockfiles for reproducible environments:

```toml
[uvve]
version = "0.1.0"
generated = "2023-12-01T12:00:00"

[environment]
name = "myproject"
python_version = "3.11.0"

dependencies = [
    "requests==2.31.0",
    "click==8.1.7",
    # ... other packages
]

[metadata]
locked_at = "2023-12-01T12:00:00"
platform = { system = "Darwin", machine = "arm64" }
```
